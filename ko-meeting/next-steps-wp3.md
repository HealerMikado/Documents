| What? | Who? | When? | Notes |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| blueprint, or more exactly to have the work environment for the Hackathon | Norway, Insee (Frédéric), Romain, Sweden | M6 | Contenairize environment on a laptop, perhaps in a virtual machine for those who use Windows with docker and docker compose, java, dotNet core |


### Suggestions / expectations for Roma hackathon

Publish the code in public repository
But for Roma hackathon it more cautious to bring code on the laptop

Create a rocket chat or slack channel in order to organize the tasks ==> Trygve will send the link (bit.ly/i3s-slack)

To have a build chain : Maven and Java
But the only thing necessary for the Hackathon participant is to have Virtual Box on
