**Description**: The bulk mailer service can be used to send personalized mails to a large number of recipients. It is a utility services that can be used in various stages of the statistical process, for example data collection, validation and dissemination. The service would be developed on the base of an internal tool built by Insee as part of its data collection platform, called SPOC. This tools has proved very useful for industrializing a lot of activities that were independently performed by a number of teams, resulting in duplication of work and incoherence of communication towards the recipients. Although the service is not on the SCFE list (support services were actually not considered when establishing this list), Insee believes that it is a solid candidate for a shared CSPA service.
