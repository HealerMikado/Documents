**Description**: As part of the overhaul of its survey data collection platform, Insee has invested important resources during the last few years in the development of a visual questionnaire design tool, named Pogues. With this tool, the survey managers can very quickly design their questionnaires in a full WYSIWYG way, and export the result as DDI or PDF. Pogues was created as a companion tool of the Eno questionnaire generation service that was successfully proposed for reuse in the SCFE ESSnet. It is already available under different packagings, including a containerized version. Note that Pogues could also be seen as a Web questionnaire visualisation service (number 10 in the SCFE list).
