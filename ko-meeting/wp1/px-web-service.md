**Description**: The file format PX is a standard format for statistical files and is used by a large group of statistical agencies. There is a package of software for this format: PX-Win, PX-Web and PX-Edit. The PX format contains metadata (variable texts, codes, source, date, etc.) and data. It can handle multi-dimensional data. PX-Web is a solution for the web, it is used to establish dynamic tables from PC-Axis files. PX-Web can also be a part of a solution with connection to SQL databases. The PX-Web applications are generated automatically from a PC-Axis database i.e. a catalogue structure containing PX-files. By using style sheets, the application will fit into most web site layouts.

PX-Web is free of charge since January 2015. To see examples, one can navigate to: https://www.scb.se/sv_/PC-Axis/Programs/PX-Web/PX-Web-examples/.

A shared service for dissemination of statistics would be created by transforming the currently used closed source solution to an open source solution. The transformation would include adapting to open standards such as .NET Core and HTML5 as well as assuring that the service can be used in cloud and/or containerized environments.

Statistics Sweden will continue the development of this service after the project has ended. If there are other parties interested in contributing to the project we will also set up a platform for continued development in a collaborative form.
