# I3S kick-off meeting

## Minutes

### Tour de table and expectations :

Many of the expectations are shared by all the participants in the ESSNet. The project is seen as an opportunity to go forward
in sharing services and an enabler in a context where it is not easy to obtain resources. For those who have not
been part of the first ESSNet, this KO meeting is a good start point to have more information.
The focus put on the architectural aspects and the building of a container platform is appreciated.
Along with the technical questions, the organisational aspects are mentioned :
* how does it work in real life ?
* what can be released in the CSPA catalogue ?
* how to discuss with non-IT people ?
* how to support services after integration ?
