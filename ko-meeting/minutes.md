# I3S kick-off meeting

## Minutes

### Tour de table and expectations

Many of the expectations are shared by all the participants in the ESSNet. The project is seen as an opportunity to go forward
in sharing services and an enabler in a context where it is not easy to obtain resources. For those who have not
been part of the first ESSNet, this KO meeting is a good start point to have more information.
The focus put on the architectural aspects and the building of a container platform is appreciated.
Along with the technical questions, the organisational aspects are mentioned:
* how does it work in real life ?
* what can be released in the CSPA catalogue ?
* how to discuss with non-IT people ?
* how to support services after integration ?

### ESSNet Presentation

The I3S (Integrating Shared Statistical Services) ESSNet is following the SCFE ESSnet. Like this
first part, the objectives of the ESSNet are to foster the reuse of statistical services
among the National Statistical Institutes. This secnd part focus more particularly on new services
and technical implementation.

Questions and remarks:
* There is a schedule for the reuse of the service, is reuse in production an explicit goal ? Eurostat answer:
no, it is different from SCFE1, containerizing is important but not exactly linked with developing new services.
* Reusing is also a question of documentatin, organisation... containerization can lower the barrier of deployment in IT system
* SCFE has shown that most of the time was used because of organisational aspects
* tghe ESSNet will have to provide guidelines on how to implement a shared service
* WP4 should provide success stories and not so successful stories. Real stories provide much experience on what are the main difficulties.
* The catalogue is not yet an appstore, we have not already a lot of experience in putting services in the catalogue. With more experiments will come more feedbacks.

### WP1 - presentation

Questions and remarks:
* Ror evaluation each DO will have to evaluate its own development regarding the 3 A dimensions, and ROs will evaluate at least 3 services for reuse.
* The methodology developed in WP4 of SCFE1 has been put in a EU Survey, now it is usable by everybody.
* Some services in the list are costly to reuse, or even not possible to reuse. Some could be merged (for example: Data loader and Content validation).
* How to know the desire for the services ? It has been evaluated for some during SCFE1, it is the first A dimension (Attractivity)
* If the service has already an implementation in the CSPA catalogue, it can't be chosen another time for another implementation because it brings nothing in GSBPM coverage.
